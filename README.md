# MATRIX (but nicer ðŸ˜Ž)

### First thing first
```
npm install
```

### For husky activation
```
npm run prepare
```

### Init the Vite server
```
npx vite
```

### Check the test stuff
#### In order to test, open another terminal window and then use the following
```
npm run test
```
# How it works
### Is the same matrix you have to build, but created in a sugar nicer way âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨
#### I'm using all the knowledge you gathered along the course (nothing strange or weird, I promise)
